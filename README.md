Graph does so much it almost makes my uses of it feel trivial but I use it alot to centralize information and help guide decision making and automation.

There is a lot of important information about setting up certificate based access and the security permissions you need to access certain calls.  

This is just some scripts that I hope will help people who have gotten over those hurdles and want to gather some information about their tenant.
